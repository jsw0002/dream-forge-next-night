# Exploring the World of Markdown

Welcome to this **sample blog post**! Markdown is a fantastic tool that allows you to write formatted text easily and simply. In this post, we’ll go through various markdown elements to help you visualize how they appear on your blog.

---

## Headers

Markdown supports multiple header levels, from `h1` to `h6`. Here’s how they look:

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

###### Header 6

## Text Formatting

Markdown allows for various text formatting options:

- **Bold text** using double asterisks: `**Bold text**`
- _Italic text_ using single asterisks: `*Italic text*`
- ~~Strikethrough~~ using double tildes: `~~Strikethrough~~`

You can also combine styles, like **bold and _italic_** text.

## Lists

There are two main types of lists: ordered and unordered.

### Unordered List

- Item 1
  - Sub-item 1.1
  - Sub-item 1.2
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
   1. Sub-item 3.1
   2. Sub-item 3.2

## Links and Images

Here’s how you can add links and images in markdown.

### Links

To add a link, use `[link text](URL)`. For example:

[Visit OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)

### Images

To embed an image, use `![alt text](image-url)`. Here's an example:

![Markdown Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg)

## Code Blocks

Markdown also supports code snippets, both inline and as blocks.

### Inline Code

Use backticks to display inline code, like this: `console.log("Hello, Markdown!");`.

### Code Block

To include a larger block of code, use triple backticks and specify the language (like `js`, `python`, etc.):

```javascript
// Sample JavaScript code
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

## Tables

Markdown tables are a bit limited, but they are great for simple data:

| Syntax   | Description         | Example      |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Header   | Title of the table  | `# Header`   |
| **Bold** | Makes text bold     | `**Bold**`   |
| `Code`   | Inline code styling | `` `Code` `` |

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are useful for displaying quotes or highlighting important information:

> "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today."  
> — Franklin D. Roosevelt

You can also nest blockquotes for a more layered look:

> Level 1
>
> > Level 2
> >
> > > Level 3

## Horizontal Rules

Use three or more hyphens (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`) to create horizontal rules that separate sections.

---

## Inline HTML

Markdown allows some HTML tags for more control over content. For example:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Centered Text with HTML</strong>
</div>

You can also use `<br>` tags to add line breaks where markdown syntax might not work.

---

## Conclusion

This post has covered various markdown elements to give you a comprehensive overview. Now you can use this as a reference to test styling across your blog’s interface. Whether it’s headers, text formatting, lists, or even tables, Markdown provides a simple way to structure your content.

Happy coding, and enjoy building out your blog!
